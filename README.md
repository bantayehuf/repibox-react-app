# Remaining TODO items
1. Progress simulation spinner in not showing on user search items.

# Things that I could improve or fix if I had more time
1. Make website has more responsive, interactive, atractive.
2. Create recipe view page instead of just open link from another site (If there is API)


### Additional, I have wrote just a simple unit test case to test API
To fetch items and search specific items (src/API.test.js)
